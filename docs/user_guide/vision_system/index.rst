Vision System Manual
====================

In this manual the installation and usage of the vision system is covered.

The vision system serves as support for selecting appropriate actions during the disassembly process. This is enabled by detecting disassembly objects and their properties, which is used in the decision process. 

The following chapters describe setup of the cameras and the vision pipeline, which decides which disassembly step or skill should be performed next.
