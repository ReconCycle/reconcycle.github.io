Modular robotic platform and the archetypical module
------------------------------

The ReconCycle robotic workcell has been designed as a modular platform, which can be used
for building fully modular robotic workcells. A functional robotic workcell consists of several
interconnected modules, each of them augmented with its own specialized equipment to achieve
full functionality.
